## To Regex Range

This is a fork of the original [to-regex-range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-regex-range) on NPM. This fork has been modified to remove reliance on Node built-ins, such as: `util`, `path`, `process`. The benchmarks, tests, and other dev-related files have been removed, putting the entire focus on source code, and making it easier to keep this repo in sync with upstream changes.
